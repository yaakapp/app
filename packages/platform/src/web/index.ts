/**
 * The browser host: Yaak in a tab, with no install and nothing running locally.
 *
 * The desktop host forwards to a Rust process. This one forwards to a worker
 * running the same model layer compiled to wasm, over a `MessagePort` instead
 * of Tauri's IPC. The worker owns the database and is shared by every tab on
 * the origin, so two tabs stay coherent for the same reason two desktop windows
 * do: one process holds the data and pushes every write to all of them.
 *
 * Sending goes through a small stateless server, because a page cannot see a
 * response the way a desktop app can (see send.ts). What a page genuinely
 * cannot do is not faked: there is no file dialog, no second window, no
 * clipboard read without a prompt. Those report false through `capabilities`
 * and refuse with a reason if called anyway, so a missing feature shows up as a
 * disabled control or a toast that explains itself, never as a silent no-op.
