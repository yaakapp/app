/**
 * The process that owns the database.
 *
 * On the desktop that is the Rust binary: it holds SQLite, every window talks
 * to it, and it pushes model writes to all of them. In a browser this worker
 * plays that part. It loads the model layer compiled to wasm, opens the one
 * database, answers each tab's commands over its port, and fans every
 * `model_writes` out to every port — so two tabs are coherent for the same
 * reason two desktop windows are, not because of a side channel.
 *
 * It is a SharedWorker, and only that: the browser hands every tab on the
 * origin the same one, which is what makes "one database owner" true without
 * anyone coordinating. It still takes a Web Lock before opening the database,
 * for the one overlap the browser doesn't rule out — a tab reloading itself,
 * whose old worker may still be letting go while the new one comes up.

 * gets its `hello` immediately regardless of how long the model layer takes to
 * download and compile — and the tab can therefore tell "this worker is dead"
 * from "this worker is busy" with a short timeout.
