/**
 * Sending an HTTP request from a tab.
 *
 * A tab can't see a response the way the desktop can — CORS hides most headers,
 * redirects are followed silently, there is no timeline — so the network half of
 * a send happens on a small stateless server (`crates-server/yaak-web`).
 * Everything else happens here, against this tab's own database, in the same
 * order the desktop does it:
 *
 *   1. create the `http_response` row (state: initialized);
 *   2. resolve and render the request in the worker (`prepare_http_send`: the
 *      environment chain, inherited headers and auth, request settings, cookie
 *      jar — the desktop's `HttpSendInputs`, in Rust, on the same model layer);
 *   3. POST the rendered request to the server and consume its stream: timeline
 *      events, the response head, body chunks, and a terminal frame;
 *   4. write what comes back where the desktop writes it — the response row as
 *      it progresses, `http_response_event` rows for the timeline, the body
 *      blob under the response id, the cookie jar with the server's changes.
 *
 * The server keeps nothing. Every byte it sees comes from this tab and every
 * byte it returns is stored by this tab.
