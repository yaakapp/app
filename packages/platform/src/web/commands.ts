 * model layer answers them — same queries, same migrations, same cascade
 * rules — so nothing about *what a model is* is decided in this file. What is
 * decided here is the rest of the desktop's command surface: a handful of
 * fixed answers that are true of a browser tab, and the refusals. The refusals
 * are the important half: a command that silently returns nothing leaves the
 * UI showing something that isn't true, whereas a refusal with a reason becomes
 * a toast the user can act on. So each unsupported command is listed by name
 * with the reason, and anything not listed at all is refused generically
 * rather than guessed at.
 *
 * The command names are `keyof RpcSchema`, the same generated wire schema the
 * desktop's router is built from, so a command renamed or added in Rust shows
 * up here as a type error rather than as a runtime surprise.
