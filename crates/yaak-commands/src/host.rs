//! What a command needs from whatever is running it.
//!
//! A command handler is invoked on behalf of one client (a desktop window today)
//! and needs a handful of things from its surroundings: the shared engine
//! managers, who the client is, what the client is looking at, and a little
//! about the app. `Host` is that handful and nothing more. The desktop
//! implements it over a `WebviewWindow`; a server would implement it over a
//! connection. Handlers are generic over it, so the same handler body runs
//! under either without knowing which.
//!
//! The surface grows only when a handler being moved here needs something new,
//! and stays as narrow as those handlers allow. What is deliberately *not* here
//! is anything only a desktop can do — open a native window, run the updater,
//! show a native dialog — those handlers stay with the desktop.
