 * declared locally and dispatched by name, which is the one place this host
 * does not share the desktop's guarantees: the desktop builds its router from
 * the schema, so every command has a handler by construction. Here a renamed
 * command would surface as a runtime "not a command this host answers".
 *
 * The fix is `yaak-commands` (the `Host` trait), not more machinery here —
 * its `models::*` handlers are already this file, typed. Three things have to
 * give before a wasm host can register them:
 *
 * 1. `Host: Send + Sync`, which a browser cannot satisfy: there is one thread
 *    and the connection pool is an `Rc`.
 * 2. `models_delete` reaches for `spawn_blocking`; there is nothing to spawn
 *    onto here.
 * 3. `yaak-commands` depends on `yaak` and `yaak-plugins`, which pull the HTTP
 *    stack and the Node sidecar and do not build for wasm32.
 *
 * None of those are hard; they are just not this PR.
