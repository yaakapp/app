//! Where connections come from.
//!
//! Every query in the model layer asks a pool for a connection, uses it, and
//! hands it back. That is the whole contract, and it is the one place the
//! desktop and the browser genuinely differ: the desktop has threads and wants
//! an r2d2 pool; a browser tab has one thread, no way to spawn another, and one
//! connection is exactly enough. Everything above this module is identical on
//! both.
//!
//! On native targets `SqlitePool` *is* `r2d2::Pool` — a type alias, so nothing
//! that already builds pools changes. On wasm it is one connection that every
//! `get()` hands out a shared handle to.
//!
//! A `SqliteConn` only ever derefs immutably. The code above this layer opens
//! transactions with [`rusqlite::Transaction::new_unchecked`], which takes
//! `&Connection`; the `&mut` that `Connection::transaction` demands is a
//! compile-time guard against nesting a transaction on one connection, and it
//! is what would have forced the wasm pool to lend its connection exclusively.
//! The model layer nests connections freely — a helper that already holds one
//! calls another that asks for its own — so an exclusive lend would panic on
//! the second ask. Sharing the handle instead makes nested *reads* work the way
//! they do on the desktop; nested *write transactions* fail on both, only
//! differently (here SQLite refuses the inner `BEGIN`; natively the inner
//! call waits for the one writer connection, which the outer call holds, and
//! times out).
